Justin â€” your final portfolio package (dark purple edition)

Files included:
- index.html        (open directly in browser or its on vercel)
- style.css         (main stylesheet)
- picture/          (place your profile image as picture/picture_na.jpg)
- Note: Contact form action is set to send to: justinrayver.14@gmail.com via Formspree's email endpoint.
  If you prefer Formspree form ID endpoint, replace the form action with your form endpoint like:
    https://formspree.io/f/your-form-id

How to use:
1. Unzip the package and double-click 'index.html' to open locally.
2. Replace picture/picture_na.jpg with your real photo to show it in the hero.
3. To receive form submissions, you may need to configure Formspree or rely on the mailto fallback.

If you want this deployed to GitHub Pages or Netlify, tell me and I'll prepare a deploy-ready repo structure.
